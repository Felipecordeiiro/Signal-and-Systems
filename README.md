#### Work 1 
This work was composed by 6 questions. Each questions trying mensure how much you understand about signals in function of a one dimension (series) or two dimension (images), from basics to intermediare.

Some contents studied:
- Expressing a complex signal
- Expressing a signal on time 
- Ploting standard signal such as step signal
- Applying some techniques of processing image

#### Work 2
This second work was composed by 7 questions. Each questions trying mensure how much you understand about signals and create and apply Low-Pass filter, from basics to advanced and, data used in this work was two audios.

Some contents studied:
- Expressing a signal on time 
- Conversing a signal from time to frequency
- Ploting a signal in frequency and time
- Ploting our Low-Pass Filter
- Ploting a signal filtered both in time and frequency
- Understand the importance of wc and l in our Low-Pass Filter
